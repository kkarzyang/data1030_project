# data1030_project
This project will mainly focus on a machine learning problem which is about predicting whether a given employee is going to be promoted or not. This study will play an important role in modern sociology research, as scientists can study peopleâ€™s behavior in the company. Junior employees or even students currently in school may also be interested in this topic because they want to know a way to help them get promoted. This
is a binary classification problem and the dataset is from Kaggle. There are 13 features in total for the data set. The data was splitted for cross validation. 4 different algoirthms were used and different hyperparameters were tuned to find the best model. Results are discussed in the report.
